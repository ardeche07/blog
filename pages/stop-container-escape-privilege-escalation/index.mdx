_Container escape_ is a security risk in which malicious players can leverage a containerized application’s vulnerabilities to breach its
isolation boundary, gaining access to the host system’s resources.

Once an attacker accesses the host system, they can escalate their privilege to access other containers running in the machine or run
harmful code on the host. Depending on how vulnerable the host is, the actor could also access other hosts in the network.  

Needless to say, container escape and privilege escalation attacks can be devastating — costing you sensitive information from files or
databases or leading to entire applications going down. For example, in 2020 [two
vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-discovers-vulnerabilities-in-azure-functions-stumbles-across-false-oracle)
were discovered in [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) that allowed attackers to escape the
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, escalate privileges, and execute code to overwrite packages. 

As a security-aware administrator or developer, you need to know how to prevent such attacks. This article will demonstrate how container
escape works and how to mitigate this risk. 

## How do container escapes happen?

Attackers logged into a container can exploit different vulnerabilities:

* Leveraging any software running with privileged mode to run malicious commands on the host
* Building and running a container with bind parameters to mount the host’s filesystems and deploy payloads to them
* Exploiting vulnerabilities like kernel bugs, poor configuration, or weak access controls for privilege escalation
* Escalating privilege on the host to access other containers

## What happens when a container is escaped?

After escaping the container, an attacker will attempt to escalate their privilege. [Privilege
escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) means the attacker logs into the host system using an account with elevated
access privileges. With this, the attacker gains control of the whole system.

With privilege escalation, attackers can cause mayhem. They can stop and destroy all containers running on the host, start their own
containers using malicious code, access databases or files in the machine or network, mount volumes, remove or corrupt critical
configuration files, run crypto mining, or worst of all, connect to a [C2
server](https://medium.com/dnsfilterofficial/how-a-c2-server-is-leveraged-in-a-botnet-command-and-control-attack-42d03da1e5f5) to await
further instructions.  

### The ImageMagick example

[*ImageMagick*](https://imagemagick.org/) is a platform to edit, compose, and convert digital images. It consists of multiple command line
tools and programming language binaries commonly used in applications for image processing, such as changing the format, resizing, and other
transformations.

Unfortunately, ImageMagick involves several weaknesses, including the infamous [ImageTragick](https://imagetragick.com/) vulnerability that
can cause command injections or remote code execution. The vulnerabilities can also lead to file deletion or moving and server-side request
forgery (SSRF). 

Say you’re developing an image processing application using ImageMagick code. But [ImageMagick’s code may have vulnerabilities within
itself](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=imagemagick) that are exploitable. How do you prevent that?

Instead of running it on a host (physical or virtual) by itself, you can run ImageMagick as a containerized application. By default, a
container runtime creates an isolation layer between a host and the application container and between containers running on the same host.
Containers reduce an application’s surface area, protecting the host by blocking access to it. 

You have other options as well:

* Containerize only stable versions of ImageMagick.
* Enable least required permissions for your code that calls ImageMagick libraries.
* Run ImageMagick binaries with minimal permissions and minimal network access.
* Run separate, stripped-down versions of ImageMagick libraries in separate containers for different image processing tasks.
* Run vulnerability scanners and automatically apply security patches on both the container runtime and ImageMagick.

Without such basic but necessary steps, you risk any vulnerabilities being exposed and exploited — even within a containerized setup.

## How to prevent container escape and privilege escalation

But are these measures enough to prevent container escape and privilege escalation? Not always.

New vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in container runtimes like Docker or orchestration platforms like
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). You can patch them, but the threat landscape is always evolving. 

The key to ensuring security is to implement multiple layers of defense mechanisms between the container and an attacker. Here are some ways
you can do so:

### Use a robust authentication system

An authentication mechanism can largely prevent attackers from accessing your containers and escalating privileges. Such mechanisms may
include risk-based authentication RBA, [context-based access
controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-based_access_control#:~:text=Context%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(CBAC,for%20intranets%2C%20extranets%20and%20internets)),
multi-factor authentication, [role-based access control (RBAC)](/rbac-and-abac-with-aws-iam/), or [privileged
access management (PAM)](https://goteleport.com/use-cases/privileged-access-management/).  

Enabling Zero Trust security and [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) for the
containerized application also reduces risk. 

### Implement a strong network policy

A solid network security policy permits only specific traffic types or sources to a given network, host or application. This can be applied
at the container level, so only specific ports are exposed from the container. Strict network policies can also isolate host clusters to
their subnets, enabling network or host-based intrusion prevention systems and alerting.

### Don’t run containers as root

While container runtimes may need root access to run, containers don’t; however, in many cases, developers run it as root because it’s
easier. Root users can access, read and write any file in the host’s file system, and running containerized applications as the root user
allows container escape.

To address this issue, you can set up a policy to restrict developers or administrators from running containers as root. For example, you
can specify a non-root user when creating container images, enabling the minimal system access required to execute tasks. You can also
[utilize user namespace when running processes in a privileged container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/). 

Also, creating a user with a known GID and UID in a Dockerfile and running your processes with that user can help secure your container
during runtime. 

### Adopt safe image practices

Use security best practices when creating container images.

When a container builds, it layers different changes on top of the base image. Often, the base image is sourced from a public image
repository. Instead of depending on public repos, use private registries where base images are already downloaded and pre-scanned for
vulnerabilities. You can also use [Kubernetes security scanners](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-hack-kubernetes/) to check for
vulnerabilities in your existing container images. 

Automate the image build process and incorporate vulnerability scanning. Once a new image version is built, all containers running old
versions should be gradually migrated to the latest one.

Furthermore, you can use `docker scan` to detect vulnerabilities in Docker local images. It will help you deeply analyze an image’s security
posture and take immediate actions as needed. You can trigger the scan from the command line to see the vulnerabilities detected. Fixing
these issues will allow secure container deployments. 

### Patch and upgrade containers 

When a vulnerability scanner finds an issue with a running container, it may not always be possible to stop it immediately and start with an
updated image. This is where immediate patching and upgrading can help thwart any possible attack.

### Monitor the runtime environment

Some vulnerabilities always remain hidden and can lead to security risks; therefore, it’s essential to proactively monitor the application
in the runtime environment for anomalies. This involves analyzing runtime logs, user activities, network traffic, file access patterns, and
other data. There are both open source and commercial monitoring solutions like Nagios, Splunk, OSSEC, or Snort that can automate
application monitoring. 

### Team effort

Lastly, implementing an effective defense requires a team effort. Having skilled and responsible professionals in your team can help you
maintain security for your containers and the clusters that run them.

## Using serverless functions as alternative

In today’s cloud-native world, most organizations have either migrated some or all of their workloads to the cloud or are considering doing
so. Public cloud providers now offer features that can run what’s known as serverless functions. 

*Serverless functions* are small code snippets that run in the cloud providers’ managed environments. Behind the scenes, the cloud provider
ensures the compute runtime is always available for running the user’s code. Once the code finishes, the runtime is destroyed. Every time
the code runs, a new compute environment is assigned to it. The only drawback is that, due to the ephemeral nature of the underlying compute
environment, the user’s code cannot persist data in the compute environment—although it can do so in other mediums like the cloud provider’s
object storage. AWS offers this feature via [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), GCP via [Cloud
Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), and Azure via [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).

Depending on the use case, this can be a good replacement for running your own containers — either in dedicated hosts or in managed
environments — which eliminates the risk of container escape and privilege escalation. [An application based on serverless functions can be
hewn together with API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-lambda-integration.html)
to delegate certain features to different serverless functions, and the Gateway can route client requests to the appropriate functions.

Using the ImageMagick example, a graphics application might perform manipulations on user-uploaded images using separate serverless
functions. Each function could call the relevant ImageMagick library necessary for its task, and the serverless code could load the
ImageMagick libraries as part of its initialization. Once the code finishes running, the runtime containing the ImageMagick library would
also be removed.

## Conclusion
 
Container escape and the ensuing privilege escalation are severe security risks. Attackers can leverage vulnerabilities in your
containerized applications to reach the host and take control of it — accessing sensitive data or causing service disruption. Still, there
are steps you can take to minimize or eliminate this risk so that you keep your applications safe.
